## Question 1 (4 points)

Give the first six terms of the following sequences starting with the value specified.

|Description|First 6 terms in the Sequence|
|:-:|:-:|
|A geometric sequence in which the first value is 5 and the common ratio is 7|5, 35, 245, 1715, 12005, 8403|
|An arithmetic sequence in which the first value is 3 and the common difference is 2.|3, 5, 7, 9,11, 13|
|A geometric sequence in which the first value is 36 and the common ratio is 1/4.|36, 9, 2.25, 0.5625, 0.140625, 0.03515625|
|An arithmetic sequence in which the first value is 9 and the common difference is -1/2.|9, 8.5, 8, 7.5, 7, 6.5|

## Question 2 (20 points)

Write recursive functions in python that will return the value of $f_n$ term for the following recurence relations.  The test code will generate $f_0, f_1, \text{ ... } , f_9$

|Function|Sequence|
|:-:|:-:|
|`fun1`|$f_0 = 5\\f_n=f_{n-1} + 3n \text{, for } n \ge 1$|
|`fun2`|$f_0 = 1\\f_n=n^3+f_{n-1} \text{, for } n \ge 1$|
|`fun3`|$f_0 = 1\\f_1 = 3\\f_n=f_{n-1}*f_{n-2} \text{, for } n \ge 2$|
|`fun4`|$f_0 = 1\\f_1 = 5\\f_n=f_{n-1}+(f_{n-2})^2 \text{, for } n \ge 2$|

```python

def fun1(n):
    # Add recursive code here
    if n == 0:
        return 5
    else:
        return fun1(n-1) + 3*n


def fun2(n):
    # Add recursive code here
    if n == 0:
        return 1
    else:
        return n**3 + fun2(n-1)


def fun3(n):
    # Add recursive code here
    if n == 0:
        return 1
    elif n == 1:
        return 3
    else:
        return fun3(n-1) * (fun3(n-2))


def fun4(n):
    # Add recursive code here
    if n == 0:
        return 1
    elif n == 1:
        return 5
    else:
        return fun4(n-1) + fun4(n-2)**2


print([fun1(n) for n in range(10)]) # [5, 8, 14, 23, 35, 50, 68, 89, 113, 140]
print([fun2(n) for n in range(10)]) # [1, 2, 10, 37, 101, 226, 442, 785, 1297, 2026]
print([fun3(n) for n in range(10)]) # [1, 3, 3, 9, 27, 243, 6561, 1594323, 10460353203, 16677181699666569]
print([fun4(n) for n in range(10)]) # [1, 5, 6, 31, 67, 1028, 5517, 1062301, 31499590, 1128514914191]
```

## Question 3 (6 points)

Evaluate the following sums manually:

|Summation|Value|
|:-:|:-:|
|$\displaystyle\sum_{i=0}^{5}3i+1$|51|
|$\displaystyle\sum_{i=1}^{4}(-1)^i$|0|
|$\displaystyle\sum_{i=0}^{5}2^i$|63|

## Question 4 (20 points)

Write a list comprehension in Python for each of the following.  The `sum` function is called in the test code to evaluate the $\sum$.

|Seq #|Value|
|:-:|:-:|
|1|$\displaystyle\sum_{k=1}^{53}k^3$|
|2|$\displaystyle\sum_{k=4}^{27}2^k - 2$|
|3|$\displaystyle\sum_{k=-3}^{18}k^5 + 1$|
|4|$\displaystyle\sum_{k=-2}^{7}2^k$|

```python
seq1 = [n**3 for n in range(1, 54)]

seq2 = [2**n - 2 for n in range(4,28)]# Add list comprehension here

seq3 = [n**5 + 1 for n in range(-3, 19)] # Add list comprehension here

seq4 = [2**n for n in range(-2,8)] # Add list comprehension here

print(sum(seq1)) # 2047761
print(sum(seq2)) # 268435392
print(sum(seq3)) # 6656947
print(sum(seq4)) # 255.75
