**Instructions**: Select the correct answer (a, b, c, or d) for each question below.  It is highly recommended that you record your answers on a paper copy of the exam.  After solving each problem, record your answers in the I-Learn quiz.  After you submit the quiz in I-Learn, you will be shown the problems that you got wrong.  Reconsider the problems you got wrong and then resubmit your test a second time.  When you resumit your test a second time with the I-Learn quiz, you will need to record the answers to all problems.  Your final score will be the maximum of the two submittals.
