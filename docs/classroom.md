# CSE 280 - Classroom Examples

In class, we will use a website called REPL to write and execute Python code related to the material we are learning.  You should create a free account on https://replit.com/ which will allow you to save code we use in class into your own account.  The links below provide the starting code for our classroom demonstrations as well as the completed code:
