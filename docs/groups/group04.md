**Instructions**: Work on all questions as a group as instructed during class.  We will review each answer during class.

## Question 1

For each of these functions, determine if they are well-defined, one-to-one, and/or onto.  For these problems, let $A = \lbrace x \in \mathbf{Z} \mid 0 \lt x \lt 5$.  Additionally, draw a picture of each function (with dots and arrows).

* $f : A \to A, \text{ where } f = \lbrace (1,2),(2,2),(3,3),(4,3) \rbrace$
* $f : A \to A, \text{ where } f = \lbrace (1,1),(2,2),(3,4),(4,3) \rbrace$
* $f : A \to A, \text{ where } f = \lbrace (2,2),(3,4),(4,3) \rbrace$

## Question 2

For each of these functions, determine if they are well-defined, one-to-one, and/or onto.  Consider using a graphing calculator like https://www.desmos.com.

* $f : \mathbf{Z} \to \mathbf{Z}, \text{ where } f(x) = 5x-7$
* $f : \mathbf{Z}^+ \to \mathbf{Z}^+, \text{ where } f(x) = \lfloor \frac {x}{5} \rfloor$
* $f : \mathbf{R} \to \mathbf{R}, \text{ where } f(x) = x^5-3x$
* $f : \mathbf{R} \to \mathbf{R}, \text{ where } f(x) = \frac{1}{x}$

## Question 3

**Part 1**

Find the inverse $f^{-1}(x)$ of the following functions:

* $f : \mathbf{R} \to \mathbf{R}, \text{ where } f(x) = (x - 32) * 5/9$
* $f : \mathbf{R}^+ \to \mathbf{R}^+, x \ne 0 \text{ where } f(x) = \frac{1}{2^x}$

**Part 2**

Select a value of $x$ (per the domain) and calculate $(f^{-1} \circ f)(x)$ for both functions in Part 1 to demonstrate that the inverse was successfully created.
