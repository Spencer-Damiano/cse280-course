**Instructions**: Work on all questions as a group as instructed during class.  We will review each answer during class.

## Question 1

Write down all the elements of $\lbrace A, B, C\rbrace \times \lbrace H,K \rbrace$.

## Question 2

Identify four values that are in the following set:

$\lbrace x \in \mathbf{Z}^- \mid x+3 \text{ is a multiple of 5} \rbrace$

## Quesiton 3

Let $A = \lbrace 1,3,5,7,9,11,13,15,17 \rbrace$, $B = \lbrace 2,4,6,8,10,12,14 \rbrace$, $C = \lbrace1,3,6,9,12,15,17,20 \rbrace$ and the universal set is $U = \lbrace x \in \mathbf{Z} \mid 0 \le x \le 20\rbrace$.  Find the following:

* $(A \cup B) \cap C$
* $C - B$
* $B - C$
* $\overline{B}$
* $C \oplus B$

## Question 4

Define the sets $A$, $B$, $C$, $D$, and $E$ as follows:

* $A = \lbrace 1, 2, 6 \rbrace$
* $B = \lbrace 2, 3, 4 \rbrace$
* $C = \lbrace 5 \rbrace$
* $D = \lbrace x \in \mathbf{Z} \mid 1 \le x \le 6 \rbrace$
* $E = \lbrace x \in \mathbf{Z} \mid 1 \lt x \lt 6 \rbrace$

Answer the following questions:

* Do the sets $A$, $B$, and $C$ form a partition of the set $D$?  If not, which condition of a partition is not satisfied?
* Do the sets $B$ and $C$ form a partition of the set $D$?  If not, which condition of a partition is not satisfied?
* Do the sets $B$ and $C$ form a partition of the set $E$?  If not, which condition of a partition is not satisfied?
