**Instructions**: Work on all questions as a group as instructed during class.  We will review each answer during class.

## Question 1

A multiple choice test consists of five questions, each of which has four choices.  Each question has exactly one correct answer.  

* How many different ways are there to fill out the answer sheet?
* How many ways are there to fill out the answer sheet so that four answers are correct and one is incorrect?
* William guesses randomly at each answer.  What is the probability that he gets three or fewer questions correct?

## Question 2

## Question 4

Email data suggests that 80% of all email is spam.  Furthermore, 10% of all spam emails contain the word "alert".  By contrast, only 2% of non-spam emails contain the word "alert".  What is the probability that a randomly chosen email message is spam, given that it contains the word "alert"?  Use Bayes Theorem to solve.


## Question 5

* What is the probaility that the group will have no italian chefs?
