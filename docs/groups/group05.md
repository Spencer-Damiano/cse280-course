**Instructions**: Work on all questions as a group as instructed during class.  We will review each answer during class.

## Question 1

Let $X = {0,1,2,3,4}$.  Define a relation $R$ on $X$ such that $xRy$ if $x+y=4$.  Draw an arrow diagram associated with the relation.  Should we use arrows on the diagram or just lines?

## Question 2

Define a relation on $\mathbf{Z}$ by $aRb$ if $a^2=b^2$.  Is $R$ an equivalence relation?

## Question 3

Define a relation on $\mathbf{Z}$ by setting $xRy$ if $xy$ is even.  Find counterexamples to show that $R$ is neither reflexive nor transitive.

## Question 4

Are the following an equivalence relationship with the domain as $\lbrace A, B, C, D \rbrace$?  Why or why not?

* $\lbrace (A,B), (B,A), (C,D), (D,C) \rbrace$
* $\lbrace (A,A), (B,B), (C,C), (D,D) \rbrace$
* $\lbrace (A,B), (B,C), (C,B), (A,C), (C,A), (B,A), (A,A), (B,B), (C,C), (D,D)

## Question 5

Draw the following four arrow diagram for relations in the domain ${A, E, I, O, U}$ as follows:

* Reflexive Only
* Symmetric Only
* Transitive Only
* Reflexive, Symmetric, and Transitive
