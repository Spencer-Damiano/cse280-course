**Instructions**: Work on all questions as a group as instructed during class.  We will review each answer during class.

## Question 1

Solve for $n$ in the following:

* $n \text{ div } 7 = 5 \text{ , } n \text{ mod } 7 = 1$
* $n \text{ div } 6 = 6 \text{ , } n \text{ mod } 6 = 2$
* $n \text{ div } 5 = 7 \text{ , } n \text{ mod } 5 = 3$

## Question 2

For the values of ($x,y)$ below, determine if $x \equiv y(\text{mod } 11)$:

* $(37,12)$
* $(52,19)$
* $(131,10)$
* $(14,13)$

## Question 3

Find the GCD and LCM for the following values that are represented with non-decreasing prime factorization.  Write you answers using non-dereasing prime factorization as well.

* $x = 2^4 \sdot 5^2 \text{  , } y=2^3 \sdot 3^2$
* $x = 7^3 \sdot 13^2\text{  , } y=2^5 \sdot 11 \sdot 13^3$
* $x = 2^4 \sdot 3^2 \sdot 5 \sdot 7^2\text{  , } y=3^2 \sdot 7^2$

## Question 4

Find the numbers in the set $S = \lbrace -23, -13, -4, 4, 13, 23, 8, 15, 46 \rbrace$ that are part of the equivalence relation $\mathbf{R}_4$.  In other words, find the numbers from $S$ that are congruent $(\text{mod } 4)$ and put them into the appropriate equivalence classes.
