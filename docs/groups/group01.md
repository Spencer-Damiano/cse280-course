# CSE 280 Group 01

(c) BYU-Idaho - It is an honor code violation to post this
file completed or uncompleted in a public file sharing site.

**Instructions**: Work on all questions as a group as instructed during class.  We will review each answer during class. 

## Question 1

Let the following statements by given:

* $p = $ "You used the pool in the afternoon."
* $q = $ "You cleaned up after lunch."
* $r = $ "You must clean up after dinner."

**Part 1**

Use connectives (operators) to translate the following statement into formal logic:

"If you used the pool in the afternoon and you didn't clean up after lunch, then you must clean up after dinner."

**Part 2**

Construct a truth table for the formal logic statement you found in Part 1.  The eight rows of your table should correspond to the eight differe possibilities for $p$, $q$, and $r$.

**Part 3**

Suppose that the statement given in part 1 is false.  What must be true about your pool usage and cleanup duties?  Explain how to justify your answer using the truth table.

## Question 2

Use a truth table to prove that the statement $[(p \lor q) \land (\neg p)] \to q$ is always true, no matter what $p$ and $q$ are.  What do we call this type of statement?

## Question 3

Let $s$ be the following statement:  "If it's raining, then the ground is wet."

**Part 1**

Give the converse of $s$.

**Part 2**

Give the contrapositive of $s$.
