# CSE 280 Group 11

(c) BYU-Idaho - It is an honor code violation to post this
file completed or uncompleted in a public file sharing site.

**Instructions**: Work on all questions as a group as instructed during class.  We will review each answer during class.

## Question 1

Use the Eulcid Algorithm to find the $gcd$ for the following pairs of numbers.  Use tables as we did in class.

* $gcd(80,32)$
* $gcd(560,792)$

## Question 2

Use the Extended Euclid Algorithm to express the answers to question 1 as a linear combination.

## Question 3

Create public and private RSA keys.  Use the two prime numbers:  $p=163$ and $q=431$.  Calculate $N$ and $\phi$.  Selet a value $e$ such than $gcd(e,\phi) = 1$.  Use the Extended Eulicd Algorithm to find the multiplicative inverse of $e \text{ mod } \phi$ and call the result $d$.

Determine the equations to encrypt and decrypt.
